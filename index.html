	<h2 style = "padding-top:30px;">Introduction</h2>
	<p>We chose this dataset because we are not a fan of hate crimes. Our group feels that hate crimes are a very relevant topic in todayâ€™s society as they are unfortunately not a rare occurrence. We have learned through our studies at UCSD that data is powerful in telling narratives and understanding trends that may not be immediately obvious. As a result, we feel that by choosing this dataset, we can learn from these previous tragedies to understand and prevent new hate crimes through education. By using geolocation as an attribute we are able to understand which parts of our country do well in its acceptance of diversity and which parts still need improvement.
	</p>
	<p>
	To deal with the sheer size of our dataset, we have randomly sampled 10% of the data in order to be able to handle it within D3 and properly display it through a web browser. To account for the reduction in size, we have multiplied applicable datapoints by 10 in attempt to keep visualizations as accurate as possible.
